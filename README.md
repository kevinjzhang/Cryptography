A mix of cracking early codes such as the Vigenere cipher and useful cryptography functions (Inverse in a finite field). 

AES specification is also implemented (with GF[256] algebra methods). AES.out shows an example of applying the encryption and the
associated steps which can also be found in the matching documentation (Appendix B: Cipher Example 1). AES.in is the required
input file for this. The S-box and round keys are also shown.
